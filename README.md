# Clicky game
Clicky game is a memory game created with react, the application renders different pet images to the screen, each image can be clicked but not more than once to earn points!

## Overview
The game keeps track of the user's score, which is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. If the user's click the same image more than one, the score would be reset to 0. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
